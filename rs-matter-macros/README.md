# rs-matter-macros: The Rust Implementation of Matter Library - Procedural Macros

* Proc-macros for deriving the `FromTLV` and `ToTLV` traits
* An `import!` proc-macro for generating Matter clusters' meta-data and handler traits

NOTE: The macros are re-exported by the `rs-matter` crate which should be used instead of adding a direct dependency on the `rs-matter-macros` crate.
